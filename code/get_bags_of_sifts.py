    # matrix 'vocab' where each row is a kmeans centroid or visual word. This  #

    # feature representation. In this case, d will equal the number of clusters#
    # or equivalently the number of entries in each image's histogram.         #
    
    # You will want to construct SIFT features here in the same way you        #
    # did in build_vocabulary.m (except for possibly changing the sampling     #
    # rate) and then assign each local feature to its nearest cluster center   #
    # and build a histogram indicating how many times each cluster was used.   #
    # Don't forget to normalize the histogram, or else a larger image with more#
    # SIFT features will look very different from a smaller version of the same#
    # image.                                                                   #
